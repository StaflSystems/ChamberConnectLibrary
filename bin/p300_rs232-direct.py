====== 

Application interface for controlling ESPEC P300 operations. 
This program may be and can be reimplemented with additional
call methods to utilize the P300 operation modes from its 
class and method definitions. 

The program has been modified from its original code that made use of
the original call methods from chamberconnectlibrary file p300.py. 
To make is easy and accessible, this file has been modified 
and placed under a new filename (p300serial.py) to provide a 
direct call to each method. The ESPEC P300 library has been 
extracted, modified and formalized to support all the available features. 

The following is a simple sample call program to serve as a starting 
point on how to utilize our ESPEC P300 library. Programmer can implement
or/and modify to include more complex call methods for their 
specific application. All you need to do is create a new definition with 
a specific call to the "p300serial.py" library and include that call
in the main method.

How to Determine Communication Port: 
===================================

MS Windows: COM? How to determine COM number assigned by MS Windows OS.
DOS command to list COM ports: \> chgport

GNU/Linux: /dev/ttyUSB? How to determine USB number assigned by Linux. 
Linux command to list /dev/ttyUSB: $ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB* 

How to find COM or USB number: 
MS Windows:
1. At the CMD prompt, issue:
   chgport
2. Study the list of COM numbers in output.
3. Plug in the USB-to-Serial cable and reissue the command: 
   chgport
4. Study the list of COM numbers in out put again. A new device with COM number 
should be listed, such as (for example): 

   COM5 = \Device\VCP0

5. Use this COM number in the program. Example: 
   port = '//./COM5' 

GNU/Linux 
1. At the shell terminal, issue:
   ls -l /dev/ttyUSB* 
2. Study the list of USB numbers in output.
3. Plug in the USB-to-Serial cable and reissue the command: 
   ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
4. Study the list of USB numbers in output again. A new device with USB? number 
should be listed, such as (for example): 

   /dev/ttyUSB0

5. Use this number in the program. Example: 
   port = '/dev/ttyUSB0' 

Tested: 
GNU/Linux platform: Python 3.8.x, 3.9.x, 3.10.x
MS Windows platform: Python 3.9.x
