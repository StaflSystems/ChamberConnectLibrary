Application interface for controlling ESPEC P300 and SCP220
features. This program may be reimplemented with additional
call methods to utilize ESPEC P300 and ESPEC SCP-220 operations
from each of their class and method definitions. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
README:
======

The following is a sample program call to the Library to control ESPEC P300
controller via the RS232 communication protocol. The program provides options
to select ESPEC P300 or ESPEC SCP-220 for operation. This sample program 
had been successfully tested with: EPSEC P300 and SCP-220 via the RS232
communication interface; P300 TCP/IP has not been tested (but should work);
TCP/IP communication is offered here without further support.  

It is programmed to provide a simple call function to our ESPEC 
ChamberConnectLibrary to connect to "especinteract.py" program which in 
turn communicates with the "p300.py" library offer and utilize the 
operational features from "p300.py", including scp220.py, in the 
chamberconenctlibrary directory. 

Note: "especinteract.py" supports both features of communication protocl: 
    1. Serial RS-232/RS485
    2. TCP/IP

This sample program utilizes and explains the use of option 1. 

The programmer may add the additional methods or program sections to call 
the library for the exact feature(s) not implemented here to meet their 
requirement. Thus, the following program serves as a starting point on how 
to utilize our ChamberConnectLibrary in the Python 3 environment. 

Tested: 
GNU/Linux platform: Python 3.8.x, 3.9.x, 3.10.x
MS Windows platform: Python 3.9.x
